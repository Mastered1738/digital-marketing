        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that brings TypeScript support to your backend development. It follows a modular architecture and is built around a set of principles that promote scalability, maintainability, and efficiency in building server-side applications.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding the MVB Architecture</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          NestJS embraces the MVCS architecture, which extends the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern by adding Services (S). Hereâ€™s a breakdown:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mt-4">
          <li><strong>Model:</strong> Represents the data structure of your application. It is usually defined as TypeScript classes or interfaces.</li>
          <li><strong>View:</strong> In the context of NestJS, the view is the representation of data sent back to clients, often as JSON responses.</li>
          <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Handles incoming requests, interacts with services, and manages the flow of data.</li>
          <li><strong>Service:</strong> Contains the business logic and performs data manipulation tasks. Services are reusable across controllers and promote code modularity.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Controllers</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning the appropriate HTTP responses. They are decorated with route paths and HTTP methods like <code>@Get</code>, <code>@Post</code>, etc.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Services</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Services encapsulate the business logic of your application. They are injectable classes that can be shared across different controllers and modules.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Modules</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Modules are containers for different parts of your application. They group related controllers, services, and other providers. NestJS uses modules to organize code and manage dependencies.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Dependency Injection (DI)</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              DI is a design pattern used in NestJS to inject dependencies into components (controllers, services) rather than creating them directly. It promotes reusability, testability, and maintainability.
